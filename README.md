An [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) that gives AI assistants direct access to your Help Scout inboxes, conversations, and threads. Search tickets, pull context, spot patterns, and get answers without leaving your editor or chat window.

Built by a Help Scout customer who wanted to give his support team superpowers. If you handle customer conversations in Help Scout and want AI to help you work faster, this is for you.

## What You Can Do

- **Search conversations** by keyword, date range, status, tag, email domain, or ticket number
- **Pull full thread history** into context before drafting a reply
- **Reply to conversations** with draft mode for safe review before sending
- **Add internal notes** visible only to staff
- **Update conversation status** (active, pending, closed)
- **Get conversation summaries** with the original customer message and latest staff response
- **Run reports** on company metrics, productivity, happiness, response times, and more
- **Monitor inbox activity** across multiple inboxes with a single query
- **Stay compliant** with optional PII redaction and scoped inbox access

## Quick Start

### Claude Cowork (Recommended)

Install the **helpscout-navigator** plugin. It auto-starts the MCP server and includes **navigation skills** that help Claude pick the right search tool for your query.

1. Open Cowork and go to **Customize** > **Browse plugins** > **Personal**
2. Click **+** > **Add marketplace from GitHub** and enter `drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server`
3. Install **helpscout-navigator** from the marketplace
4. Add your Help Scout credentials ([step-by-step guide](guides/cowork-setup.md))

> The plugin bundles guided skills, session hooks, and tool selection guidance on top of the MCP server. Other install methods give you the tools; this one also teaches the AI how to use them well.

### Claude Desktop

**One-click install** using [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions):

1. Download the latest [`.mcpb` file from releases](https://github.com/drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server/releases)
2. Double-click to install (or drag into Claude Desktop)
3. Enter your Help Scout App ID and App Secret when prompted

### Claude Code

The same **helpscout-navigator** plugin works in Claude Code with the same navigation skills.

1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code to open the marketplace
2. Search for **helpscout-navigator** and install it
3. Set `HELPSCOUT_APP_ID` and `HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET` as environment variables
4. Restart Claude Code

### For Cursor, VS Code, and Other MCP Clients

Add to your MCP client's config file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "helpscout": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["help-scout-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HELPSCOUT_APP_ID": "your-app-id",
        "HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET": "your-app-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -e HELPSCOUT_APP_ID="your-app-id" \
  -e HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET="your-app-secret" \
  drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server
```

## Getting Your API Credentials

1. Go to **Help Scout** > **My Apps** > **Create Private App**
2. Select at minimum: **Read** and **Write** access to Mailboxes and Conversations (write is needed for replies, notes, and status updates)
3. Copy your **App ID** and **App Secret**

> Help Scout uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow exclusively. Personal Access Tokens are not supported.

| Help Scout UI | Environment Variable |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **App ID** | `HELPSCOUT_APP_ID` |
| **App Secret** | `HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET` |

Alternative names `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_ID` / `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_SECRET` and legacy `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY` are also supported.

## Tools

### Which tool should I use?

| Task | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| List recent tickets | `searchConversations` | "Show me active tickets from this week" |
| Find by keyword | `comprehensiveConversationSearch` | "Find conversations about billing errors" |
| Look up a ticket number | `structuredConversationFilter` | "Show me ticket #42839" |
| Complex filters | `advancedConversationSearch` | "All @acme.com conversations tagged urgent" |
| Quick conversation overview | `getConversationSummary` | "Summarize this conversation" |
| Full message history | `getThreads` | "Show me the complete thread" |
| Reply to a conversation | `createReply` | "Draft a reply to this customer" |
| Add internal note | `createNote` | "Add a note about the DNS issue" |
| Change conversation status | `updateConversationStatus` | "Close this conversation" |
| Company overview metrics | `getCompanyReport` | "How many conversations did we handle this month?" |
| Productivity metrics | `getProductivityReport` | "What's our average first response time?" |
| Customer satisfaction | `getHappinessReport` | "Show satisfaction scores for Q1" |
| Conversation volume | `getConversationsReport` | "Conversation trends over the last 30 days" |
| Current server time | `getServerTime` | Used for time-relative searches |

Inboxes are auto-discovered when the server connects. AI agents get inbox IDs in their instructions automatically, so no lookup step is needed.

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HELPSCOUT_APP_ID` | App ID from Help Scout My Apps | Required |
| `HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET` | App Secret from Help Scout My Apps | Required |
| `HELPSCOUT_DEFAULT_INBOX_ID` | Scope searches to a specific inbox | None (all inboxes) |
| `HELPSCOUT_BASE_URL` | Help Scout API endpoint | `https://api.helpscout.net/v2/` |
| `REDACT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | Hide message bodies in responses | `false` |
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Cache duration for API responses | `300` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`) | `info` |

## Compatibility

Works with any [MCP-compatible](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client:

| Category | Clients |
|----------|---------|
| **AI Assistants** | Claude Desktop, Goose, and other MCP-enabled assistants |
| **Code Editors** | Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Continue.dev |
| **Command Line** | Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode |
| **Custom** | Any application implementing the MCP standard |

## Security and Privacy

Built with compliance-minded teams in mind:

- **Optional PII redaction.** Message bodies are included by default. Set `REDACT_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true` to hide them for stricter compliance requirements.
- **Secure authentication.** OAuth2 Client Credentials with automatic token refresh.
- **Rate limit handling.** Automatic retry with exponential backoff on 429 responses.
- **Scoped access.** Optional default inbox configuration limits what the AI can search.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication failed?** Verify your credentials work with Help Scout directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.helpscout.net/v2/oauth2/token \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$HELPSCOUT_APP_ID&client_secret=$HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET"
```

**Empty search results?** Common causes:
- Using the wrong search tool (use `searchConversations` for listing, `comprehensiveConversationSearch` for keyword search)
- Inbox ID mismatch. Check the IDs from server instructions, not guessed values.
- Search terms too narrow. Try broader terms or a longer time range.

**Need more detail?** Enable debug logging:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npx help-scout-mcp-server
```

## Development
